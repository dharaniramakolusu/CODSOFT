                <h2>The Queen of Jhansi</h2>
                
                <p>Lakshmibai Newalkar, the Rani of Jhansi ( 19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858), was the Maharani consort of the princely
                     state of Jhansi in Maratha Empire from 1843 to 1853 by marriage to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar.
                      She was one of the leading figures in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, who became a national hero and symbol 
                      of resistance to the British rule in India for Indian nationalists.
                    Born into a Karhada Brahmin family in Banares, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao,
                     in 1842. When the Maharaja died in 1853, the British East India Company under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie
                     refused to recognize the claim of his adopted heir and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse. She led the   successful 
                     defense of Jhansi against Company allies, but in early 1858 Jhansi fell to British forces under the command
                      of Hugh Rose. The Rani managed to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in capturing Gwalior, where they 
                      proclaimed Nana Saheb as Peshwa of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in June 1858 after being mortally
                       wounded during the British counterattack at Gwalior.</p>

                <h3>Early life</h3>
                <p>Jhansi was named Manikarnika Tambe and was nicknamed Manu.Her father was Moropant Tambe and her mother Bhagirathi
                     Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri 
                     district of modern-day Maharashtra. Her mother died when she was five years old. Her father was a Commander
                      during the war of Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district. 
                       Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for women in India's society at this
                        time.And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to fight against social norms even
                         in front of the whole society.</p>

                <h3>The Revolt of 1857</h3>
                <p>On 10 May 1857, the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When news of the rebellion reached Jhansi, the Rani asked
                     the British political officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for her
                      protection; Skene agreed to this. The city was relatively calm amid the regional unrest in the summer of 
                      1857, but the Rani conducted a Haldi Kumkum ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide 
                      assurance to her subjects, and to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of them.
                     The Rani's involvement in this massacre is still
                     a subject of debate. An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the rebellion characterizing her as the
                      "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".There was then an invasion 
                      of Jhansi by the forces of Company allies Orchha and Datia; their intention however was to divide Jhansi between
                       themselves. The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed by the governor-general that she
                        was responsible for the massacre and no reply was received. She set up a foundry to cast cannon to be used on
                         the walls of the fort and assembled forces including some from former feudatories of Jhansi and elements of 
                         the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in August 1857. Her intention at this time was still
                          to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.</p>

                <p>On 17 June she recognized the soldier and fired at him with a pistol, whereupon he
                        "dispatched the young lady with his carbine". According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai,
                         the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a cavalry leader, was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture
                          her body, she told a hermit to burn it. After her death, a few local people cremated her body.</p>
